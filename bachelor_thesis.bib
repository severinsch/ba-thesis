An improved version of an algorithm for finding the strongly connected components of a directed graph and at algorithm for finding the biconnected components of an undirect graph are presented. The space and time requirements of both algorithms are bounded by \$k\_1 V + k\_2 E + k\_3 \$ for some constants \$k\_1 ,k\_2 \$, and \$k\_3 \$, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges of the graph being examined. }

	abstract = {The use of web applications has become increasingly popular in our routine activities, such as reading the news, paying bills, and shopping on-line. As the availability of these services grows, we are witnessing an increase in the number and sophistication of attacks that target them. In particular, SQL injection, a class of code-injection attacks in which specially crafted input strings result in illegal queries to a database, has become one of the most serious threats to web applications. In this paper we present and evaluate a new technique for detecting and preventing SQL injection attacks. Our technique uses a model-based approach to detect illegal queries before they are executed on the database. In its static part, the technique uses program analysis to automatically build a model of the legitimate queries that could be generated by the application. In its dynamic part, the technique uses runtime monitoring to inspect the dynamically-generated queries and check them against the statically-built model. We developed a tool, AMNESIA, that implements our technique and used the tool to evaluate the technique on seven web applications. In the evaluation we targeted the subject applications with a large number of both legitimate and malicious inputs and measured how many attacks our technique detected and prevented. The results of the study show that our technique was able to stop all of the attempted attacks without generating any false positives.},

	abstract = {SQL injection attacks pose a serious threat to the security of Web applications because they can give attackers unrestricted access to databases that contain sensitive information. In this paper, we propose a new, highly automated approach for protecting existing Web applications against SQL injection. Our approach has both conceptual and practical advantages over most existing techniques. From the conceptual standpoint, the approach is based on the novel idea of positive tainting and the concept of syntax-aware evaluation. From the practical standpoint, our technique is at the same time precise and efficient and has minimal deployment requirements. The paper also describes wasp, a tool that implements our technique, and a set of studies performed to evaluate our approach. In the studies, we used our tool to protect several Web applications and then subjected them to a large and varied set of attacks and legitimate accesses. The evaluation was a complete success: wasp successfully and efficiently stopped all of the attacks without generating any false positives.},
