\noindent

In the last couple of years, I have supervized numerous bachelor's and master's
thesis and various seminars. This led to a broad observation of typical
questions and issues the students faced when writing their thesis or papers.
Surprisingly, they are always quite similar. This template aims to give advise
to future sstudents in order to answer the most frequent questions and avoid the
most common mistakes. It provides the TUM template which has already been
accepted many times, shows the most basic outline and some tips on the contents
of each chapter. It further contains some tips on the style of scientific works.
An evaluation on a small set of students showed that this guideline can assist
in making progress faster. However, we found that we have to keep improving the
tips to achieve better results.

Your abstract goes here. The typical structure is:
\begin{itemize}
\item Broad description of the current state
\item Gap in the current state
\item Your contribution
\end{itemize}
