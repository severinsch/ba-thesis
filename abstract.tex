As more and more aspects of our daily lives move online, the security of online data becomes increasingly important. SQL injections are among the most common threats to online security, and detecting potential vulnerabilities in source code is crucial to preventing such attacks. To successfully detect such vulnerabilities in source code, static analysis tools need information about the strings from which the queries are built.

In this thesis, we adapt an approach to extract formal grammars that describe strings from a code property graph. We combine this approach with other techniques to obtain a human readable regular expression, matching all possible values of the analyzed string.
We provide a proof-of-concept implementation and show that it is able to accurately describe complex strings. We think, that with further development, the information our approach provides can be used to successfully detect SQL injection vulnerabilities.
