\section{Motivation}

The increasing reliance on software applications in various aspects of modern life has led to a growing concern for the security of these applications. Among the many security threats that can affect software, injection vulnerabilities are among the most dangerous and prevalent. According to the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), injection attacks, which include SQL injection, LDAP injection, and command injection, are consistently listed as one of the top ten web application security risks \cite{owasp}.

Injection vulnerabilities occur when an attacker is able to insert malicious code or input into an application, often through input fields that accept user input such as search boxes or login forms. This can result in the attacker gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data, executing arbitrary code, or even taking control of the entire system.

To assist developers in spotting injection vulnerabilities in their code, there exist a variety of tools and techniques, including static analysis tools for string values. These tools analyze the source code of an application to identify potential vulnerabilities, including injection vulnerabilities. Static analysis tools are particularly useful because they can detect vulnerabilities that may not be apparent during testing or manual code review. Making developers aware of such issues during development enables them to fix the vulnerability early.

In order to detect injection vulnerabilities, such tools can try to analyze the possible values a string that is passed as a query to e.g. a database can take on.

From these inferred properties, a tool can then assess, whether the analyzed program contains any potential injection vulnerabilities and warn the programmer.

For example, consider a string variable, that is used as an SQL query and is determined to be described by the regular expression \Verb@DELETE \* FROM myTable WHERE id='.*'@.
This information can be used to issue a warning during a static analysis, because the analyzed program allows for an arbitrary unchecked string to be inserted into the SQL query, which is a severe security vulnerability.

\section{Contribution}

In this thesis, we extend a \acf{cpg} implementation \cite{cpg} to increase its capabilities in analyzing string values. We adapt a theoretical approach by Christensen et al. \cite{brics}, which creates regular languages describing the values of a string, to the present \ac{cpg} implementation. Christensen et al. work on a different representation of the analyzed code and use the result in a different way. For example they use a different definition of the \ac{dfg} and a novel data structure representing the complete analyzed code, from which they extract \acp{dfa}. We only analyze parts of the code that are required for the specific query. Therefore, using their approach requires adaption of the used techniques and solving of new problems like the handling of string operations for our use case. We also want to provide the information to an analyst in a human-readable format, in our case in the form of regular expressions.
To achieve this, we first combine the mentioned approach with an algorithm by Nederhof \cite{nederhof} to transform the obtained results to automata. Further we use state elimination with a heuristic by Delgado and Morais \cite{delgado} to convert them to regular expressions for users. We also provide a working proof of concept implementation covering a subset of the Java standard library.

After providing some theoretical background in Chapter \ref{chapter:Background}, we first present some related work in Chapter \ref{chapter:RelatedWork} and then describe the different steps of our approach in Chapter \ref{chapter:Approach}.
In Chapter \ref{chapter:Evaluation}, we then evaluate the results and benchmark our implementation. There, we also highlight some limitations of our approach and include ideas for future continuation and improvement of the presented design before concluding the outcome of this thesis in Chapter \ref{chapter:Conclusion}.
