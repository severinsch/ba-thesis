The introduction is a bit like a teaser. Here, you dig more into details, also
technical ones. After this chapter, the reader must understand why you do this
work, why it's important, what makes it difficult and what you want to achieve.

\begin{itemize}
\item What's the problem that you're trying to solve?
\item What is your goal?
\item What is/are the research question(s)?
\item What are special problems?
\end{itemize}
