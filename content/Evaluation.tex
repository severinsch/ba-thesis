    \item E.g. case studies, large-scale studies, test bench, etc.
    \item What did you do to verify results (if applicable)
    \end{itemize}
\item What did you learn from these tests? Depends on your work. E.g.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item TP/TN/FP/FN rates
    \item Performance
    \item Results of your studies
    \item Interpretation of the results, lessons learned
    \end{itemize}
